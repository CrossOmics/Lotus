# Lotus

A single-cell RNA sequencing analysis package for preprocessing, clustering, visualization, and differential expression analysis.

## Installation

Install the lotus package in development mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This will make the `lotus` package available system-wide without needing to set `PYTHONPATH`.

## Lotus Embedding Projector

We developed an interactive analysis tool, available at `Interactive-Lotus/`. See the [Interactive-Lotus README](Interactive-Lotus/README.md) for setup instructions. We also support a [lightweight web demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/zzq1zh/Lotus-hf) for demonstration. 

**Note:** The web demo has computational resource limitations and only supports very small datasets.

## Documentation
